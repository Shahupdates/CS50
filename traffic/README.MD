During my experimentation with the traffic sign recognition model, I observed a significant improvement in accuracy over the epochs, 
eventually achieving a 93.05% accuracy on the test set. Initially, the loss was high but it decreased significantly as the epochs progressed, 
indicating a good learning pace. However, I noticed a peculiar spike in training time during the 8th epoch, which was unexpected. 
The final accuracy of approximately 93% is satisfactory, but I believe there might be room for further optimization to either enhance accuracy 
or efficiency of the model.
