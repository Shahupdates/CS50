# My AI Projects

This repository showcases my journey through various AI projects. Below are some of the projects I've worked on:

## Project 1: Traffic Sign Recognition (Traffic)
Built a CNN using TensorFlow to classify traffic signs from the GTSRB dataset. Experimented with different architectures to improve accuracy.

## Project 2: Attention Analysis (Attention)
Analyzed attention heads in a transformer model to infer relationships between words in sentences. Explored how attention correlates with linguistic structures.

## Project 3: Crossword Generator (Crossword)
Developed an AI to generate crossword puzzles, implementing constraint satisfaction algorithms to fill the crossword grid efficiently.

## Project 4: Six Degrees of Separation (Degrees)
Implemented a breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest connection chain between any two actors in a large dataset.

## Project 5: Knights Tour (Knights)
Explored various heuristics to solve the Knight's Tour problem, a classic problem in computer science and artificial intelligence.

## Project 6: Minesweeper (Minesweeper)
Built an AI to play Minesweeper, using knowledge representation and inference to make safe moves.

## Project 7: Nim (Nim)
Implemented an AI that learns to play the game of Nim optimally using Q-learning.

## Project 8: PageRank (PageRank)
Developed an AI to rank web pages by simulating the algorithm used by search engines.

## Project 9: Parser (Parser)
Created a natural language processing tool to parse sentences into their constituent parts of speech and grammatical structure.

## Project 10: Shopping (Shopping)
Built a machine learning model to predict whether online shopping customers will complete a purchase.

## Project 11: Tic-Tac-Toe (TicTacToe)
Developed an AI to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally using Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning.

Each project directory contains the source code, datasets, and a detailed report of my findings and learning experiences. Feel free to explore and reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
